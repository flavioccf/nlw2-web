## 💡 Sobre o Projeto

Project created at the Next Level Week, promoted by [Rocket Seat](https://rocketseat.com.br), the initial project was called Proffy and the aim was to create a platform for students to find teachers for a variety of subjects.

In my project I made Musify, with the specific goal of connecting instruments teachers and students.

The original design provided by RocketSeat was changed to follow the Spotify color pallete.
